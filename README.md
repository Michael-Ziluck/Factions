# Lightning Factions

Ever wanted a Factions plugin that runs Lightning fast, with database capabilities, absurd amount of configuration, and an extremely dynamic API? Yeah, me too. When this project started it was just an experiment to see what levels of efficiency I could pump out of Minecraft. Since then it has grown into the most robust and most efficient Faction plugin to date.

## Preface

If you want to create a fork or simply poke around in the code, worry not. This plugin is and will remain to be open source. Richard Stallman summed it up by saying "Think free as in freedom of speech, not free beer". That being said, please pay for the compiled software on the official page. The project is maintained by a team of developers, and we like to be able to enjoy a pizza while we program every once and awhile.

For those who want to contribute to the project or modify it to their own needs, here is how to get started. A quick note however; almost everything is disableable. If you do not want a feature, turn it off in the config file. The system will, for almost everything, not use any additional memory or processing power on disabled features.

That being said, let's dive in!
